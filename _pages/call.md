## Topics

We invite submissions related (but not limited) to the following topics:

*   **Data scarcity** (synthetic data, augmentation, novel collection paradigms) in less-represented cultures/low-resource languages
*   **Dataset curation** (e.g., community-driven) in multilingual and multimodal (e.g., text, speech, vision) settings.
*   **Multimodal approaches** (e.g., text, speech, vision) to enrich understanding of less-represented cultures. Modeling morphologically rich languages and culturally-aware LLM development.
*   **Robust evaluation** of cultural understanding, value alignment, and cross-cultural reasoning.
*   **Enhancing reasoning abilities** (commonsense, logical, analogical) in AI for LRLs and diverse cultural contexts.
*   **Aligning systems** with diverse cultural values and norms, beyond surface translation.
*   **Low-resource Language (LRL) communities**: Exploring AI agent potential for tasks relevant to LRL communities and their cultural needs.
*   **Responsible AI**: Developing and deploying AI systems that ethically navigate and represent diverse global mindscapes, with a focus on fairness, algorithmic bias mitigation, data stewardship, and inclusive co-design practices to ensure equitable impact.

## Submission Details

We will solicit contributions via OpenReview. Submissions will include: research papers (short: up to 4 pages, long: up to 8 pages, excl. references/appendix) and position papers/extended abstracts (up to 4 pages) on work-in-progress, novel ideas, datasets, benchmarks, or ethical/linguistic perspectives. Submissions must primarily contain unpublished work and not substantially overlap with papers at the main NeurIPS 2025 conference. Archival status will be non-archival by default. We aim for 3 high-quality reviews per submission.

To submit your work, please visit the **[OpenReview](/)**. (Note: Link is a placeholder and will be updated)

## COI Management for Submissions
Organizers will adhere to NeurIPS COI policies. The reviewing platform (OpenReview) will prevent assignment of papers to conflicted organizers/reviewers. Organizers will recuse themselves from discussions/decisions for submissions under concern.
