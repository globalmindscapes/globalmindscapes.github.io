All cultures and languages deserve equal representation in our rapidly advancing AI landscape. However, current machine learning progress predominantly reflects a narrow set of dominant mindscapesâ€”the cultural frameworks, values, and worldviews that shape how communities understand and interact with the world. This disparity, driven by data scarcity and resource constraints, creates AI systems that inadequately represent the diverse global mindscapes of billions who use low-resource languages and hold different cultural perspectives. This workshop aims to galvanize the NeurIPS community towards addressing this critical gap by providing a focused platform for discussing cutting-edge research, novel methodologies, and future directions for developing AI systems that authentically capture and serve the rich diversity of global mindscapes.
