We have contacted the following speakers, selected for their leading expertise and diverse perspectives. All speakers will be expected to attend in person, except in exceptional circumstances.

*   **Longxu Dou** (Sea AI Lab) [Status: Confirmed]
    *   Research Scientist. Working on Natural Language Processing, particularly in multilingual LLM pre-training (Sailor/Sailor2) for South East Asian languages
*   **Monojit Choudhury** (MBZUAI) [Status: Confirmed]
    *   Professor of Natural Language Processing, MBZUAI. Professor Choudhury's research interests center around the convergence of Language Technology and Society, exploring pivotal inquiries such as the learning and (mis)representation of linguistic and cultural diversity by foundation models.
*   **Marzieh Fadaee** (Cohere Labs) [Status: Confirmed]
    *   Research scientist. Interested in natural language understanding, and particularly in multilingual learning, data-conscious learning, robust and scalable models, compositionality, and evaluation.
*   **Lucie-Aim√©e Kaffee** (Hugging Face) [Status: Confirmed]
    *   EU Policy Lead & Applied Researcher. Her research focuses on technological solutions to problems of online communities, particularly Wikipedia, with a focus on lower-resourced language communities. She has worked in cross-cultural NLP and multilingualism in knowledge graphs such as Wikidata.
*   **Yun-Nung (Vivian) Chen** (National Taiwan University) [Status: Confirmed]
    *   She is interested in spoken language understanding, multimodal application and natural language processing, with recent work in cultural NLP e.g., TaiwanLLM.
*   **David Ha** (Sakana AI) [Status: Tentatively Scheduled]
    *   CEO & Co-founder at Sakana AI. His work focuses on building new foundation models inspired by nature, such as evolution and collective intelligence. Sakana AI explores efficient methods like model merging to create adaptive AI, including culturally aware models for specific linguistic contexts (e.g., Japanese), which aligns with the workshop's interest in diverse and resource-efficient AI development.
*   **Esin Durmus** (Anthropic) [Status: Tentative - Invited]
    *   Research Scientist. Interested in socio-technical alignment: (1) explore the question of what values are (and should be) incorporated into AI systems. (2) mechanisms for incorporating more diverse values into AI development. (3) build evaluation frameworks to assess how these values impact model behavior in real-world settings.
*   **Vinodkumar Prabhakaran** (Google Research) [Status: Tentative - Invited]
    *   Senior Research Scientist. Interested in investigating (and mitigating) ethical and fairness failures in NLP models, especially for non-Western geo-cultural contexts.
